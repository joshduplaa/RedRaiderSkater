    "<p>The model's performance, which is the model's learning and generalization capabilities. is evaluated through a combination of training, validation, and testing metrics. During training, both loss and accuracy are monitored for the training and validation datasets across epochs to assess the model's learning progress and generalization ability. After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset to compute final test loss and accuracy, providing a measure of its performance on unseen data. Additionally, training and validation loss and accuracy trends are visualized through plots to identify patterns such as convergence or overfitting. Finally, qualitative evaluation is performed by testing the model on individual samples from the test set, comparing predicted classes with true labels to gain insight into its behavior in specific instances. </br> I was under the impression that my solution was overfitting at first since my first training session got up to %99.5 accuracy after 21 epochs on test data. But on subsequent training sessions, it displayed much more typical behavior but still got up to the high 90s, with 97.5% on 25 epochs and 96.3% on 30 epochs as seen in the output in the cells below. The video attached on submission is the 25 epochs run. Overall, my solution seems to have performed extremely well, with over 98% accuracy on the test set, and trained much faster than I expected, somehow outperforming the researcher's models in a few different ways.\n",
